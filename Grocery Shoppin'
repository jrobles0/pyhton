#Q1. Grocery List
#Print 5 things you need from the grocery store, each item should be output on its own line.

print("Milk")
print("Eggs")
print("Bread")
print("Bananas")
print("Oatmeal")

Q2. Grocery Receipt
Your groceries ring up as 5.63, 13.40, 3.99, 4.57, and 2.47, respectively. Use the 5 items you printed in Q1 and declare variables named after each item. Assign each item with a price listed above.
Use Python as a calculator to add your variables together and print out the total cost of all the items.

milk = 5.63
eggs = 13.4
bread = 3.99
bananas = 4.57
oatmeal = 2.47 
print(milk + eggs + bread + bananas + oatmeal)

Q3. Buy Lots
Pick your favorite snack from the 5 things you listed in Q1 and save it as a string in a variable called favorite_snack. Use the * operator to print 123 copies of it.
Use the corresponding variable you declared in Q2 that contains the price for your favorite snack and the * operator to calculate the final price for those 123 snacks and print the total cost.

favorite_snack = "potato chips"
chips = 5.37
print(favorite_snack * 123)
print(chips * 123)

Q4. Formatting
Replicate the code from the first part of Q3 but modified to separate each entry with a comma and a space. (Don't worry about having a trailing comma and space at the end). You might need to use some additional parens here.

favorite_snack = "potato chips"
print((favorite_snack + ', ') * 123)

Q5. BONUS
Can you figure out how to get the same output as Q1 above with only 1 print statement? If so, can you do it all on one line?

print("Milk\nEggs\nBread\nBananas\nOatmeal")
